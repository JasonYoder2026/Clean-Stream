## Topics Discussed

- Got Jake access to GitHub repo
- Showed prototype demo
- Discussed design phase documents for clarification and pointers
- CSC Go, what Jake likes and doesn't like about it
- Wants a clean UI to appeal to people
  
## Things Clarified
- Users should not see all available machines, just the number of available machines
- Payments are through a webportal, so you should be able to scan the QR code from camera or app

## Client Feedback on Prototype Material
- Prototype
  - Doesn't want to see machines listed
  - Wants menu bar to be opaque
- Business requirement too vague, need to shape it more
- Use cases need to be phrased better
