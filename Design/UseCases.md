# Use Cases 
- UC1- Check machine availability
  - Business Requirement: BR1
  - I think this is one of our use cases because our client wants customers to be able to see if there are any machines available before they leave the house. When the customer opens the app they should be able to select a location and see how many machines are available at that location. This fits into our clients overall goal of making laundry mats more appealing to people who use technology as well as making it more convenient for customers.
  - Actors: Customers
  - Flow:
	  - Customer opens app
	  - Customer opens map tab
	  - Customer selects location
	  - Customer is able to see available machines 
- UC2 - Reload loyalty card
  - Business Requirement: BR1
  - I think this is one of our use cases because our client wants there to be a loyalty card where the customer can add money to it so they can pay for a wash with their phone. Having this feature allows the customer to not have to worry about having enough money on their actual card or their card being locked because they have it in the app. This fits into our clients overall goal of making laundry mats more appealing to people who use technology as well as making it more convenient for customers
  - Actors: Customers
  - Flow:
	  - Customer opens app
	  - Selects the button to add money
	  - Adds the desired amount of money
	  - The money is transferred from their bank account to their clean stream wallet.
- UC3 - Use NFC to start machines
  - Business Requirement: BR1
  - I think this is one of the use cases because our client want to get rid of the need for change and make payments digital. Before you can start a machine you need to pay, so using the NFC payment enables a machine to be "awakened" or started so using NFC to start machines is a use case.
  - Actors: customers
  - Flow:
    - Customer loads laundry into machine
    - Customer opens app with loaded payment card
    - Customer can scan a QR code to the machine or tap it's NFC reader
    - Funds will be transferred from the customers card to the laundromat
    - Machine will wake up and be able to be started by the customer
- UC4 - See locations on a map
  - Business Requirement: BR1
  - This is a use case because one of the parts of the project description is that users should be able to compare locations in terms of distance and availability. To make this possible the customers should be able to see the locations on a map and see how many machines are available at each location so this is a use case.
  - Actors: Customers and possibly employees
  - Flow:
    - Customer opens the app
    - Clicks on map tab
    - Map view will show all Clean Stream laundromats in relative position
    - Tapping on a location will display the number of washers and dryers available.
- UC5 - Get notified when my cycle ends
  	- Business Requirment: BR1
  	- This is a use case because it is one of the high level features that the client asked for. This will help the customers of the laundry mat get their clothes as soon as they are done which can save on time my making sure that people get their clothes making another machine open.
  	- Actors: Customers
  	- Flow:
  		- Customer loads laundry into machine
  	   	- Machine washes laundry
  	   	- Machine notifies app that it is done
  	   	- Customer comes and gets laundry out
- UC6 - Track transaction history
  - Business Requirement: BR1
  - I think this is one of the use cases because our client emphasized to us that we should be tracking transaction history.
    This data will mostly be used by the laundromat employees. The flow of this will be that when a transaction is made that
    the transaction data will be stored somewhere inside of our database. 
- UC7 - Ability to unlock doors for afterhours use
  - Business Requirement: BR1
  - This is a use case because the client wanted the laundromat to be available after hours. To do this they want the doors to be unlockable by customers who have loaded their card with a set amount of money so they can do laundry and use the restrooms without the need for employees to be there. This helps save money on less staff while keeping the laundromat accessible longer.
  - Actors: Customers
  - Flow:
    - Customer loads card with at least the set amount of money
    - Customer can open the main doors to the laundromat with the same method used to open washing machines
    - Doors autolock when closed.
    - Customer can use machines and restroom
    - When customer leaves the doors will remain locked.
