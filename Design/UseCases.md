  - I think this is one of the use cases becasue our client emphasized to us that we should be tracking transaction history.
    This data will mostly be used by the laundromat employees. The flow of this will be that when a transation is made that
    the transaction data will be stored somewhere inside of our database. 
- UC7 - Ability to unlock doors for afterhours use
