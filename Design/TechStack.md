[Dart Link](https://dart.dev)

We choose to use Flutter/Dart becasue one of our requriments was that this has to be a cross platform application. The cool thing about Flutter/Dart is that you can create cross platform 
applications using only one codebase. This will allow us to deploy our application to IOS, Andriod, and the web while only writing on codebase. 


# Backend

### Supabase

Supabase is a relational databse hosting service that has real-time functionality as well as a built in authentication system. Each time you create table Supbase also automatically gives you
an api to access the table. It is also 100% open source. Overall, this is a really good tool that streamlines some of the complexities of using other database services. Our client also requested
that we use this databse, and he plans to do the intial setup of the database. 

### Nayax API

This is another API that our client requested that we use. The reason is because the laundry machines will have Nayax devices to process payments. By using this API we can allow users to pay
in our application by using NFC or scanning a QR code. Nayax also has the capability for use to create a loyalty card system which is an essential part of our application. 

# Tools

### Andriod Studio

[Andriod Studio Link](https://developer.android.com/studio)

We choose to use Andriod Studio for this project becasue of the emulator feature that is built in as well as the built in support for Flutter/Dart. Andriod studio has a really cool emulator 
feature that emulates a device so we can test our application on a device virtually. This IDE also has plugins available to support Flutter/Dart projects which is very helpful.
